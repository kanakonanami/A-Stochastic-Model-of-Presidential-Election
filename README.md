# A-Stochastic-Model-of-Presidential-Election
The Monte Carlo simulations are used to model the probability of outcomes in a random process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables. This project introduced the Monte Carlo methods to model the 2020 Presidential Election.


Poll Data Source Used in this project can be accessed from: https://www.270towin.com/2020-polls-biden-trump/. The website summarized and averaged polls for the 2020 presidential election from different electoral states.
